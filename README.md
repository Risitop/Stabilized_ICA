# Stabilized_ICA

This repository proposes a python implementation for stabilized ICA decomposition algorithm. Most of the technical details can be found in the references [1], [2] and [3].    
   
We also propose an implementation of the Mutual Nearest Neighbors method as well as a visualization tool to draw the associated network. This method is used to study the stability of the ICA components through different datasets.

## Experiments

We provide two jupyter notebooks for an illustration with transcriptomic data:
* [ICA decomposition with stabilized ICA](transcriptomic_ICA.ipynb)
* [Stability of ICA components accross several NSCLC cohorts](stability_study.ipynb)

## Data

The data set which goes with the jupyter notebook ["ICA decomposition with stabilized ICA"](transcriptomic_ICA.ipynb) can be found in the .zip file [data.zip](data.zip). Please extract locally the data set before running the notebook.   

For the jupyter notebook ["Stability of ICA components accross several NSCLC cohorts"](stability_study.ipynb) please note that you will have to load the data yourself in order to run it (all the necessary links are reported on the notebook).

## Requirements

To run this algorithm as well as the jupyter notebook, one will need the following python packages:
* joblib
* json
* matplotlib.pyplot
* networkx
* numpy
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* scipy
* tdqm 

## Examples 

#### Stabilized ICA method

```python
import pandas as pd
from algorithms.stabilized_ICA import StabilizedICA

df = pd.read_csv("data.csv" , index_col = 0)

sICA = StabilizedICA(n_components = 45 , max_iter = 2000 , n_jobs = -1)
sICA.fit(df.values , n_runs = 30 , plot = True , normalize = True)

Metagenes = pd.DataFrame(sICA.S_ , columns = df.columns , index = ['metagene ' + str(i) for i in range(sICA.S_.shape[0])])
Metagenes.head()
```

#### Mutual Nearest Neighbors method

```python
from algorithms.MNN import MNNgraph

cg = MNNgraph(data = [df1 , df2 , df3] , names=['dataframe1' , 'dataframe2' , 'dataframe3'] , k=1)
cg.draw(colors = ['r', 'g' , 'b'] , spacing = 2)

cg.export_json("example.json")
```
