# Stabilized_ICA

This repository proposes a python implementation for stabilized ICA decomposition algorithm. Most of the technical details can be found in the references [1], [2] and [3]

## Experiments

We provide a jupyter notebook for an illustration with transcriptomic data:
* [ICA decomposition with stabilized ICA](transcriptomic_ICA.ipynb)

## Data

The data set which goes with the jupyter notebook can be found in the .zip file [data.zip](data.zip). Please extract locally the data set before running the notebook.

## Requirements

To run this algorithm as well as the jupyter notebook, one will need the following python packages:
* numpy
* matplotlib.pyplot
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* tdqm
